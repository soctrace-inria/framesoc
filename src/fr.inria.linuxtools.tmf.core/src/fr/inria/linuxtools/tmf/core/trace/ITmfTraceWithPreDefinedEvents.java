 * This interface should be implemented by all trace classes who have a way to

 * external components to ask the list of events for the trace might contain.
 *
 * The methods from this interface will typically be called to determine whether
 * or not it is worth reading a trace. If we can know in advance that a trace
 * does not contain the events required by an analysis, then the analysis will
 * not be run. So the response should not involve having to actually read the
 * trace.
