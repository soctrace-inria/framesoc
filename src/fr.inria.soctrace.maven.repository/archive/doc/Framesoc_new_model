- New Framesoc Model -
----------------------

- 1 - General description -

The Framesoc datamodel has been enriched in order to support the 
concepts of State, Link, Variable and PunctualEvent.

In the old model all the events were considered as punctual event,
that is something happening at a given time. 

In the enriched model, in addition to punctual events there are also:

* State: An execution state having a start and an end timestamp. 
  It can be used to describe a period of time where a given event producer 
  stays in the same execution state.
  A state has also an imbrication level, to model a state inside another state:
  (e.g. state with imbrication = 1 is contained in state with imbrication = 0...)
  Note that a given producer, at a given time, can be in only one state of the 
  same imbrication level.

* Link: It is used to represent a directed relation between two event producer, 
  having a start and an end timestamp (which represent the start and end 
  of the relation). It can be used to represent point-to-point or collective 
  communications between processes.

* Variable: It represents the evolution of the value of a variable along time. 
  A variable has a value, a start timestamp and an end timestamp. The value does
  not change between the start and the end timestamps specified.

- 2 - Implementation details -

- Database level:

In order to support the above concepts, the following modifications have been done.

A field CATEGORY (INT) has been added to the EVENT_TYPE table.
This is an enumeration to distinguish among the 4 event categories (punctual event, link, state, variable)

Three fields have been added to the EVENT table:
* CATEGORY (INT) : replication of the category in the EVENT_TYPE, added for performance reasons.
* LPAR (BIGINT) : a long parameter, storing an information that depends on the category
* DPAR (DOUBLE) : a double parameter, storing an information that depends on the category

The following table summarizes the information stored in LPAR and DPAR for the various categories:

                LPAR         DPAR
PunctualEvent   -            - 
State           end time     imbrication level
Link            end time     end event producer id
Variable        end time     value 

- Software API level (fr.inria.soctrace.lib.model plugin)

The class EventCategory (in fr.inria.soctrace.lib.model.utils.ModelConstants) contains
the constants corresponding to the various categories.

The category must be passed to the constructor of the EventType class.

The three fields {category}, {lpar} and {dpar} have been added to the Event class,
with the corresponding getter/setter.

Four classes, inheriting from Event, have been added:
* PunctualEvent
* State
* Link
* Variable
These classes provide appropriate names for the getter/setter according to the category:
For example, the Variable class provide a getValue() and a getEndTimestamp() methods that 
wrap the corresponding getLongPar() and getDoublePar() in the Event class.
The complete documentation of the various setter/getter can be found in the source code.

Note that the methods setCategory() and setType() in the class Event check that the categories
in the Event and in the EventType are the same.

The pjdump parser (in the Framesoc archive) provides an example of usage of this API.

- 3 - Note

The imbrication level (in the State) is stored in the database, but it is not currently used by 
Framesoc, since none of the SoC-Trace partners has provide feedback on this topic yet.
Therefore, this field may change in future versions, according to possible future needs.
