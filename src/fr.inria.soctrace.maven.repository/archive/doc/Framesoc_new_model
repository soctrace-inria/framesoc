- New Framesoc Model -
----------------------

- 1 - General description -

The Framesoc datamodel has been enriched in order to support the 
concepts of State, Link, Variable and PunctualEvent.

In the old model all the events were considered as punctual event,
that is something happening at a given time. 

In the enriched model, in addition to punctual events there are also:

* State: Anything that has a beginning and ending timestamp. 
  It can be used to describe a period of time where a given event producer 
  stays at the same state.
  A state has also an imbrication level, to model a state inside another state:
  (e.g. state with imbrication = 1 is contained in state with imbrication = 0...)
  Note that a given producer, at a given time, can be in only one state of the 
  same imbrication level.

* Link: It is used to represent a directed relation between two event producer, 
  having a beginning and ending timestamps (which represent the start and end 
  of the relation). It can be used to represent point-to-point or collective 
  communications between processes.

* Variable: It represents the evolution of the value of a variable along time. 
  A variable has a value and an identifier.


- 2 - Implementation details -

- Database level:

In order to support the above concepts, the following modification have been done.

A field CATEGORY (INT) has been added to the EVENT_TYPE table.
This is an enumeration to distinguish among the 4 event categories (punctual event, link, state, variable)

Three fields have been added to the EVENT table:
* CATEGORY (INT) : replication of the category in the EVENT_TYPE, added for performance reasons.
* LPAR (BIGINT) : a long parameter, storing an information that depends on the category
* DPAR (DOUBLE) : a double parameter, storing an information that depends on the category

The following table summarize the information stored in LPAR and DPAR for the various category:

                LPAR         DPAR
PunctualEvent   -            - 
State           end time     imbrication level
Link            end time     end event producer id
Variable        id           value 

- Software API level (fr.inria.soctrace.lib.model plugin)

The class EventCategory (in fr.inria.soctrace.lib.model.utils.ModelConstants) contains
the constants corresponding to the various categories.

The category must be passed to the constructor of the EventType class.

The three fields category, lpar and dpar have been added to the Event class,
with the corresponding getter/setter.

Four classes, inheriting from Event, have been added:
* PunctualEvent
* State
* Link
* Variable
These classes provide appropriate names for the getter/setter according to the category:
For example, the Variable class provide a getId() and getValue() that wrap the corresponding
getLongPar() and getDoublePar().
The complete documentation of the various setter/getter can be found in the source code.

Note that the methods setCategory() and setType() in the class Event check that the categories
in the Event and in the EventType are the same.

The pjdump parser (in the Framesoc archive) provides an example of usage of this API.

- 3 - Note

The imbrication level (in the State) and the variable id (in the Variable) are stored in the
database, but the are not currently used by Framesoc, since none of the SoC-Trace partners 
has provide feedback yet on these two fields.
Therefore these two details may change in future versions, according to possible future needs.
