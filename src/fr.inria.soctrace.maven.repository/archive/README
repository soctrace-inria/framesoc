# Intro #

This file is a small guide about using Framesoc and developing external 
Framesoc plugins.

############################### Framesoc Usage ################################ 

# Requirements #
- Java JDK 7
- MySQL server (optional, since Framesoc uses by default SQLite, which
  is an embedded DBMS)

# System Setup #
- download Eclipse Kepler and extract the corresponding archive
- install Framesoc features (fr.inria.soctrace.maven.repository-*.zip) 
  as explained below in "Installing an Eclipse feature" 
  (pay attention to install source features if you want to develop 
   Framesoc plugins)

# Using Framesoc #
- Please refer to the Framesoc user guide, contained in this archive.

######################### Framesoc Plugin Development ######################### 

To develop Framesoc plugins familiarity with Eclipse plugin development [1]
is assumed.
Several alternatives are available.

# Option 1 #
# Using the Eclipse instance where Framesoc is installed #
- create a plugin project
- put all soctrace plugins (*.lib.* and *.framesoc.*, not *.tools.*) as 
  dependencies in the Dependecies tab of the plugin manifest
- create an Extension for the extension point: 
  fr.inria.soctrace.framesoc.core.tool.
- implement the tool class (see source doc)

# Option 2 #
# Using a virgin Eclipse for Java development #
- Extract the fr.inria.soctrace.maven.repository-*.zip archive.
- File -> Import -> Plugins and Fragments -> Next
- Import From: Directory.
- Browse to the 'plugins' directory contained in the archive extracted above.
- Import As: 'Binary projects' or 'Projects with source folders' depending if
  you want to see the source code or not.
- Add all. 
- Finish.
- Then follow the steps in "Option 1".

# Option 3 #
# Cloning the Framesoc git repository #
- To clone the Framesoc git repository and access the source code please follow
  the instruction in the REPOSITORY file, contained in this archive.
- Then follow the steps in "Option 1".

######################## Installing an Eclipse feature ########################
