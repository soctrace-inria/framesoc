# Summary #

This file describes how to configure a working Eclipse workspace for FrameSoC development.
The instructions are written for a unix system, but they should be trivially adapted
on a Windows system too.

# Requirements #

- Java JDK 7
  You can download it from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

# System setup

After cloning the git repository in <clone_directory>, please follow these steps:

- Install the latest version of 'Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers':
  - Download the package suitable for your architecture at http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  - Extract it
  - Go in the eclipse folder and launch the executable (eclipse)

- Install the Tycho m2e connector:
  - Window -> Preferences -> Maven -> Discovery
  - Press the Open Catalog button
  - Activate the Tycho Configurator
  - Click on Finish and follow the installation instructions.
  
- Set the workspace folder contained in <clone_directory>/soctrace/framesoc as 
  the Eclipse workspace and add the FrameSoC plugins.

  More in details:
  - Launching eclipse for the first time you will be asked to set a workspace: 
    - set one provided in <clone_directory>/soctrace/framesoc/workspace
  - Import the FrameSoC plugins:
   - File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
   - Set the workspace chosen before as root directory
   - Check that all projects folders are checked
   - Press Finish

- Build all the plugins
  - Project -> Clean... (ensure that Build Automatically is checked)
  - Clean all projects
